# Fórmula UTFPR - Vehicule transmission project
This is a project developed for the 2019 FSAE - Brasil competition regulated by [SAE International](https://www.sae.org/). The objective of the competition is to present and phisically test a project of a race vehicule based on the regulation and specifications required by SAE. The cars are developed by teams representing multiple universities and higher education institutions of Brasil. To understand more about the competition please access the official website of the competition [www.fsaeonline.com/](https://www.fsaeonline.com/).

This project competed in the 2019 FSAE - Brasil competition representing the Federal University of Technology – Paraná (UTFPR) with the team FÓRMULA UTFPR. You can find more about the team by its official social networks:

This repository contains specifically the part of the project related to the transmission of the vehicule, which I was part of and also leading it.

## Project requirements

The project requirements based on the official documents provided by SAE and functional testint for the vehicule transmission are contained within the following domains:

- Transfer the power and torque efficiently from the engine to the wheels
- Protection for the transmission parts
- Material for protections
- Gometry requirements for protections 
- Choose ideally solutions that improve the mass reduction of the car
